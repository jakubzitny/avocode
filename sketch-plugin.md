   [<img src="https://upx.cz/Bfo" width="241" height="59">](https://manager.avocode.com/download/sketch-plugin/mac/)
3. Open the DMG and double click the sketchplugin file inside. It should open your Sketch automatically and install / update the plugin
4. Open the plugin in menu `Plugins -> Avocode Sync 42`

## Known bugs
- If you duplicate already synced document (or artboard) to a new document it will still sync to the original design. You can fix this by syncing to a different project or by running [custom workaround script](sync-as-new-design.md)
- Sketch Pages are not exported at all, we might add that later if there is enough interest. Please [vote here](http://avocode.uservoice.com/forums/277080-feature-voting/suggestions/11634147-support-exporting-pages-in-sketch-extension-3) if you need that feature
 
## Reporting bugs
Please report bugs to team@avocode.com and include the `sketch-panels.log` file from Sketch Plugins folder

Plugin folder can be accessed from Sketch menu Plugins -> Manage Plugins and in the window click the Settings icon in bottom left corner and select Show Plugins Folder...

If there is no `sketch-panels.log` it means the extension did not launch properly, please try opening the Console App -> All Messages and look for any errors when you launch the extension.
